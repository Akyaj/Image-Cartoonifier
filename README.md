# Image-Cartoonifier

# Introduction
To build this cartoonifyer application we will use python and OpenCV. This is one of the exciting and thrilling applications of Machine Learning. While building this application we will also see how to use libraries like easygui, Tkinter, and all. Here you have to select the image and then the application will convert that image into its cartoon form. Mainly, we build this application using OpenCV and python as the programming languages.
# Open CV
OpenCV is an open-source library in python that is used mainly for computer vision tasks in the areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, openCV is playing a major role in the field of technology. Using OpenCV we can process images and videos for some tasks like object detection, face detection, object tracking, and all.

OpenCV has c, c++, java, and python interfaces and it supports all kinds of systems such as Windows, Linux, Android, Mac OS, IoS, and allâ€¦

# Requirements
- Python: We use python as a programming language for building the application.

- cv2: We use cv2 for image processing.

- nNumpy: Mainly NumPy is used for dealing with arrays. Here the images that we use are stored in the form of arrays. So for that, we use NumPy.

- easygui: easygui is a module used for GUI programming in python. In our application easygui is used to open the file box to upload images from the local system.

- Imageio: Imageio is a python library that reads and writes the images.

- Matplotlib: Matplotlib is used for visualization purposes. Here we plot the images using matplotlib.

- OS: Here in our application os is used for dealing with paths like reading images from the path and saving the image to the path.

- Tkinter: Tkinter is a standard Graphical User Interface(GUI) package.
